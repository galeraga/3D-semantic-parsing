Repo to host the UPC AIDL spring 2022 post-graduate project

## Abstract
Point clouds is a type of geometric data structure.

PointNet: Respects invariance of input points and no voxel grids are needed

Available PointNet tasks:
1) Object (shape) classification
2) Part segmentation
3) Scene semantic parsing

In this project, we'll be focus on implementing only object classification and scene semantic parsing
