## Abstract
A point cloud is a type of 3D geometric data structure, based on unordered set of vectors.
Each point is a vector of its (z, y, z) coordinate plus extra feature channels such as color, normal, etc.

PointNet: Respects invariance of input points and no voxel grids are needed

PointNet provides a unified deep learning architecture for the following application recognition tasks, based on point cloud inputs:
1) Shape classification 
2) Shape part segmentation
3) Scene semantic parsing

This project'll be focus on implementing only **object classification** and **scene semantic parsing**. As a dataset, the **S3DIS dataset** is going to be used, where every point includes both its spatial coordinates and its color info (xyzrgb).

## Main goals
This is section1 

## The dataset
The **3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces (S3DIS)** dataset is going to be used in order to work with the PointNet architecture. The dataset contains point clouds from 3 differnt buildings, distributed in 6 areas:

- Building 1: Area_1, Area_3, Area_6 
- Building 2: Area_2, Area_4 
- Building 3: Area_5 

Each area includes several rooms or spaces, an the folder structure of the S3DIS dataset is the following one:

Area_N\Space_X\
