## Abstract
Point clouds is a type of geometric data structure.

PointNet: Respects invariance of input points and no voxel grids are needed

PointNet provides a unified architecture for the following applications:
1) Object (shape) classification
2) Part segmentation
3) Scene semantic parsing

In this project, we'll be focus on implementing only object classification and scene semantic parsing. As a dataset, we'll use the S3DIS dataset.
