## Abstract
A point cloud is a type of 3D geometric data structure, based on unordered set of vectors.

PointNet: Respects invariance of input points and no voxel grids are needed

PointNet provides a unified deep learning architecture for the following applications, based on point cloud inputs:
1) Shape classification 
2) Shape part segmentation
3) Scene semantic parsing

In this project, we'll be focus on implementing only object classification and scene semantic parsing. As a dataset, we'll use the S3DIS dataset.
